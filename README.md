# Flags

## Description

This is a full-stack web application built with [React](https://react.dev/),
and bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).  It uses
[Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for a [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
database and it displays a searchable list of the flags for every country in the
world.

## Summary

This project was started as part of my time in the July 2022 cohort at Alchemy
Code Lab, in Portland, Oregon. I have since updated it multiple times so that
the project remains current with ECMAScript. I also integrated TypeScript.

## Features

An exercise in making API calls, handling the returned data, and filtering
state.

## Technologies

- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- JSX
- CSS
- React
- ESLint
- Supabase

## Run Locally

The following steps will run the project in the *development* mode:

1. Clone the project: `$ git clone https://the-project`

2. Go to the project directory: `$ cd the-project`

3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

4. Start the server: `npm run dev`

5. Open `http://localhost:5173` to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits,
and any lint errors will appear in the console.
